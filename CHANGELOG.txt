================================================================================

5/21/2018: 	- Added CHANGELOG.md (FINALLY!)
			- Exception handling (did not search for bugs- testing required)
			- Updated StaticData, ThirdPartCode, Tournament, TournamentStub
				requests to follow new format (_buildurl then _request)
			- Raised exceptions are now logged

			TODO:
				[_] Check for errors in exception handling for requests
				[_] Add specific error code handling for each method
				[_] Exception logging
				[_] Update StaticData, ThirdPartCode, Tournament, 
					TournamentStub	data structures for runes & rune paths 
					(updated and old)	
				[_] change _log to something more accessible
			Questions:
				- Is there a better method to handle the brute-force way of
					handling RequestError in all api methods?
				- Find a way to concat _buidurl and _request
				- Do away with raised exception print statements?

5/22/2018:	- Begain adding docstrings to methods (Champions). Using Google
				style docstrings.

			TODO:
				[_] Change params argument in every api method to **kwargs that 
					will accept a variable length key: value paired entries. 
					Convert to dict, then pass into the request as the expected
					dict of key-value pairs
				[_] For logging exceptions, must use the str() of each return
				[/] Convert param values in request to string, then to lower
				 	^	Not as easy as it sounds- maybe try a decorator that 
				 		will check for allowed params and make sure they are in
				 		the right format

5/23/2018	- Reformating outputs (Finished: Summoner, Champion)
			
			TODO:
				[_] Extension methods that add static data to the outputs
					(Champion names for example)
			Questions:
				- What should I name the series? What would work best in the
					longrun?
