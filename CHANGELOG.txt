5/21/2018: 	- Added CHANGELOG.md (FINALLY!)
			- Exception handling (did not search for bugs- testing required)
			- Updated StaticData, ThirdPartCode, Tournament, TournamentStub requests to follow new format (_buildurl then _request)
			- Raised exceptions are now logged

			TODO:
				- Check for errors in exception handling for requests
				- Add specific error code handling for each method
				- Exception logging
				- Update StaticData, ThirdPartCode, Tournament, TournamentStub data structures for runes & rune paths (updated and old)	
				- change _log to something more accessible
			Questions:
				- Is there a better method to handle the brute-force way of handling RequestError in all api methods?
				- Find a way to concat _buidurl and _request
				- Do away with raised exception print statements?
