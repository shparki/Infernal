5/21/2018: 	- Added CHANGELOG.md (FINALLY!)

			- Updated StaticData, ThirdPartCode, Tournament, TournamentStub
				requests to follow new format (_buildurl then _request)
			- Raised exceptions are now logged

			TODO:
				[_] Check for errors in exception handling for requests
				[_] Add specific error code handling for each method
				[_] Exception logging
				[_] Update StaticData, ThirdPartCode, Tournament, TournamentStub
					data structures for runes & rune paths (updated and old)	
				[_] change _log to something more accessible
			Questions:
				- Is there a better method to handle the brute-force way of
					handling RequestError in all api methods?
				- Find a way to concat _buidurl and _request
				- Do away with raised exception print statements?

5/22/2018:	- Begain adding docstrings to methods (Champions). Using Google
				style docstrings.

			TODO:
				[_] Change params argument in every api method to **kwargs that 
					will accept a variable length key: value paired entries. 
					Convert to dict, then pass into the request as the expected
					dict of key-value pairs
